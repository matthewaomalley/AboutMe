<h2><mark>Introduction</mark></h2>
<p>I am a Senior Computer Science student (with a concentration in Secure Programming)
    at Lewis University. <br> I grew up and currently reside in Lemont, IL. with my sister and
    two parents. I have an affinity and fascination <br> for technology, love to play the 
    acoustic guitar, & occassionally build wooden furniture as a hobby.
</p>

<h2><mark>What I hope to Learn</mark></h2>
<p>I am hoping to represent the extent of what I learned here at Lewis. I also want to learn
    more about Agile and explore <br>other technologies as I progress through this course. Mostly,
    I want to get better at working in a team to prepare for my career.
</p>

<h2><mark>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</mark></h2>
<p>As stated above, I love to build wooden furniture. Typically, I like to combine
    technology with <br>projects to serve modern functionality but have a timeless appearance.
    Last summer, I built <br>a wooden end table with a built-in, recessed wireless charger for
    compatible devices. From <br>the beginning of the process by sketching/planning to the end
    with staining and finishing, <br>I find it peaceful and rewarding.
</p>
<h2><mark>Fun Fact</mark></h2>
<p>A fun fact about me is that I got my first job when I was 15 and had various different <br>
    jobs; probably over 7 or 8 at this point.
